## 🎯 Built to solve real problems

**Tired of:**
- Theme breakage and plugin conflicts that waste your day?
- Lost sessions and endless nvim configuration rabbit holes?
- IDE-hopping fatigue and subscription walls?
- Nvim that's either too bare or too bloated?
- Being chained to your desktop to code?

**Most importantly:** Want nvim that's lazy to configure but smart to use?

**Everything you need, nothing you don't:**
- Carefully selected plugin ecosystem
- Intelligent defaults with escape hatches
- `<Space>` as leader – every command flows naturally
- 7,000+ lines refined through real-world use

---

## 🔧 Extend it

**Add language servers:**  
Drop configs in `./user/config/LspConfig/`

**Custom snippets:**  
Add JSON files to `./user/Snippets/`

It's your editor. Make it yours.

## 💎 The story

One developer. Real projects. Daily driver.  
No VC funding. No corporate agenda.

Built because the alternatives either broke constantly or charged monthly. Refined over months of production use. **It works because it has to.**
